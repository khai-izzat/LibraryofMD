## Best Practices

- **Secure your Client Secret**: Never expose it in client-side code or public repositories.
- **Use HTTPS**: Ensure all communication between your application and CENTAGATE Cloud is encrypted.
- **Regularly review permissions**: Periodically check and update the scopes your application requests to follow the principle of least privilege.
